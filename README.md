# Bayesian_Mortality_Prediction
Hand Implemented Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Logistic Regression.

Analyzed famous heart disease death set widely studied in medical literature. 
Achieved state of the art performed when compared to machine learning models, while using Bayesian Logistic regression providing a more interpretable model.
Code for posterior sampling via Hamlitonian MCMC is highly flexible and can be adapted to any data set as long as the log posterior and log gradient of the posterior is specified.
